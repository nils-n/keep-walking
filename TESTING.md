## Manual Testing

### Results of Syntax Validation with PEP8

### Results of User Stories Test

### Results of Functionality Tests

### Results of Other Tests

### Results W3C HTML Validation

All Pages were tested with the offical W2C HTML validator [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) using the option 'Validate by Direct Input', copying the rendered html code from the browser with `Right Click > View Page Source`.

All tests passed.

### Issues Found During Manual Testing

There were several issues found during Manual Testing that required refactoring of the code to make it pass the test.

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center"> TC_03 </td>
      <td> Ensure that all URLs on the Dashboard Page can only be accessed by authenticated users. For unauthenticated users it should raise 403 error.  </td>
      <td> 
         <ul>
            <li> In the first round, a 500 server error was raised. A view did not check if a user was authenticated, and tried to find records in the DB for the AnonymousUser </li>
            <li> After adding appropriate checks to the view function, the 403 error was raised correctly, and the test passed </li>
         </ul>

      <td> 
         <ul>
            <li> In the first round, it was noted that there was no feedback (in form of a toast message) telling the user that the synchronisation was successful </li>
            <li> After refactoring the corresponding view function, the correct toasts appeared, and test passed
            </li>
         </ul>
     </td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center"> TC_24  </td>
      <td> Validate that all html files pass W3C HTML Validation Tool  </td>
      <td> 
         <ul>
            <li> In the first round, all htmx attributes of the buttons created warning of the W3C HTML validator </li>
            <li> It was tried to replace buttons with spans (and even divs as per htmx documentation), same result
            </li>
            <li> It was then decided to keep the button elements, and document the validation errors. </li>
            <li> The solution was (as found on the Project-Portfolio-4 Slack Channel, 1.April 2022, M. Bodden + Ed_B_alumn) to prepend all hx-get, hx-delete etc attribues with data-hx-get, data-hx-delete. All tests passed then.  </li>

            <li> Removing the label attribute on the corresponding Django form (forms.GarminForm) ensured that the crispyform library rendered and W2C passed.

      <td> Validate that all html files pass W3C HTML Validation Tool  </td>
      <td> 
         <ul>
            <li> For the Signup page, the tailwind-cripsyform library rendered a form that did not pass the W2C HTML validator </li>
            <li> Since tailwind-crispy is still in early stages of development, there was no easy fix for this. I tried replacing the 'small' tags with 'p' tags using javascript (while the rendered page was correct, the W2C validator still complained). 
            </li>
            <li>It did not seem reasonable to create a manual form with many lines of code, only to replace the elegant one-liner <strong> forms | crispy</strong>, especially in terms of code readibility and maintainability
            </li>
            <li> In the end, i decided to leave the form rendered by crispy-tailwind.
            </li>
