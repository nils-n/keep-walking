### Results W3C HTML Validation

The only issue found during HTML validation was that [htmx](https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-get/) attributes are not yet allowed by the W3C HTML validator. I tried to replace the `button` element with a`span` and a `div` (as per original documentation of `htmx`) but same result. I then decided to use a `button` element for all the elements using `hx-get`, `hx-delete`, and leave the errors documented here.

Other than the htmx-attributes , all tests passed.

### Issues Found During Manual Testing

There were several issues found during Manual Testing that required refactoring of the code to make it pass the test.

        <th style="text-align:center"> Test Case</th>

            <li> In the first round, a 500 server error was raised. A view did not check if a user was authenticated, and tried to find records in the DB for the AnonymousUser </li>
            <li> After adding appropriate checks to the view function, the 403 error was raised correctly, and the test passed </li>
         </ul>

            <li> In the first round, it was noted that there was no feedback (in form of a toast message) telling the user that the synchronisation was successful </li>
            <li> After refactoring the corresponding view function, the correct toasts appeared, and test passed

            <li> It was tried to replace buttons with spans (and even divs as per htmx documentation), same result
            </li>
            <li> It was then decided to keep the button elements, and document the validation errors. </li>
