## Test Strategy

The test strategy consisted of a combination of manual and automated tests.

- Parts of the appliction rely on CRUD operations to an external DB and the Garmin API, manual test cases were created to ensure isolate those tests that require internet access. It may have been done with Selenium, but keeping in mind the MVP of this iteration, it was chosen to follow a manual test strategy here.
- The main parts of automated testing focussed on python unit testing with the pytest framework. Most of the functions were isolated from Django in separate files, in order to ensure atomic unit testing of pure application logic following a principle of **design for testability**. The Django functions then simply import the tested functions using pythons `import` statement.
- For a few python helper functions, the DB access was mocked using `FactoryBoy` package
- The modules for JS were tested both manual and automatically using the JEST framework

While the home page could be checkecd via URL in the automatic color contrast checker, that was not possible for the authenticated pages. For the pages that required authentication, only the color contrast check was done manually for each background-to-text color pair on the page. All Tests passed.

#### Coverage Report

Coverage of Python Unit test was `75%`. It could have been aimed to test more functions, but in terms of the MVP not every view was tested, and the test focussed on the core logic, combined with manual integration tests as outlined above in the testing strategy.

#### CI Integration

All unit tests were added to a continous integration workflow, that is being run after each push to the main branch. Several times during the development of this project, this flagged errors early on without needing to run `pytest` manually each time.
