# *Keep on Walking* - improve your health and happiness by daily walks

Have you walked 7000 steps today? According to science, a daily step count of 7000 steps is associated with increased happiness, mental health and improvement of various body parameters ( [Paluch, et. al., 2021](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2783711?utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_term=090321), [Choi, et. al., 2019](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689)). The aim of this website is to take up on this idea and promote health, fitness and happiness.

 Users are encouraged to sign up and log their daily step count using their  Garmin&copy; watch. The website will keep them on track with their step goal, and inform them if they are progessing in their goal of either reaching or maintaining a healthy BMI (body-mass-index). In addition, a simple statistic will be applied across all signed up users as to wheter meeting the targeted step count  improves their health parameters, such as increased sleep times, reduced heart variability and reduced stress levels.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories 

User stories are prioritized and categorized according to the *MuSCoW* priortization principle, aiming for 60 % must-have User Stories in the first iteration. The first iteration of this project has 14 User stories:

- 8 must-have stories (**57 %** )
- 1 should-have story (**7 %** )
- 2 could-have stories ( **14 %**)
- 3 wont-have stories ( **21 %**)


| **#** | **USER STORY**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **PRIORITY** |

## Models 

User data are stored in a relational database. The main model has been carefully designed to allow for emotional ratings and API calls from the Garmin Connect App:

- **User**: each row is a user that has signed up on the website 
- **UserProfile**: each row is a profile where the user can enter more details (height, date of birth, profile picture)
- **GarminData**:  each row is an entry as read from the Garmin API for a specific date and user

    <tr>
       <td> <img src="./assets/images/drawSQL-pp4-activity-tracker.png"; alt="ER diagram of the model" >  </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Technologies Used 

- [DrawSQL](https://drawsql.app/) 

### Languages 

- HTML
- CSS
- Python

### Frameworks 

- jQuery
- Bootstrap (V. 4.2)
- Pytest

## Deployment

The deployment consists of 2 steps : 
1.  setting up backend DB (PostgreSQL) 
2. setting up Heroku app and connect to DB

###  1.  DB Setup (PostgreSQL / ElephantSQL)

- Create ElephantSQL account (if needed) and login on website 
  - click on `create New Instance` and choose a name (recommend not using `-` or `.` in the name - that seems to cause issues)
  - use `Tiny Turtle` plan, leave Tags empty. Then select region
  - enter the new project from dashboard and copy the URL into your `env.py` template of the `DATABASE_URL` variable
- open the `settings.py` of your main django project and update the `DATABASE_URL`  

```python
 # DATABASES = {
 #     'default': {
 #         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
 #         'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
 #     }
 # }
    
 DATABASES = {
     'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
 }
```
- To confirm that we can now connect to the BD hosted on ElephantSQL, Run the migration command in your terminal to migrate your database structure to the newly-connected ElephantSQL database

```
 python manage.py migrate
```


###  2. Heroku Setup

- Login to Heroku Website and Create a new App (EU)
- Connect the App with your GitHub Repository on the Heroku Website
- Go to `Settings > Config Vars` and add your secret environment variables from your `env.py`:
  - `SECRET_KEY` = (as per `env.py`) 
  - `DATABASE_URL` = (as per `env.py`) 
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL` = (as per `env.py`) 
  - `PORT` = 8000
  - `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` = 1
  - `DEBUG` = False

### Solved Bugs 

- In a first iteration of this project, I made a mistake in the Model design where I kept the emotional rating linked to the readout from the Garmin device. This has made my life *very* difficult creating `POST` requests and handling the CRUD functionality. 
  <div style='text-align:center'>
    <table style='width:90%; content-align:center'>
        <tr>
          <td> <img src="./assets/images/first-attempt-er-diagram-model.png"; alt="first attempt of an ER diagram of the model - emotional rating and Garmin stats in same model (turned out to complicate things)" >  </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  - **Solution** : After some research (see acknowledgements), it turned out to be the best advice to go back to the Model diagram and simplify the design. In this way, the data structures reflect much better the data flow inside Django's MVT architecture. The final solution was to split the `DailyActivity` table into a `GarminData` table (readouts from the Garmin API) and a `EmotionRating` table, so that both are linked to independent requests. Also, CRUD operations for each table are independent, which is not only more natural but also leads to a cleaner implementation.   

- When comparing dates (in a View to check whether a record of a specific date already exists), the date was stored as `pandas` `Timestamp` object but the fields in the `GarminData` Model where `datetime` objects. Consequently, the comparison failed because python could not compare two different data types. 
  ```python
  [... datetime.date(2023, 9, 1), datetime.date(2023, 9, 1), ...]
  [Timestamp('2023-08-30 00:00:00'), Timestamp('2023-08-31 00:00:00' ... ]
  ```

  - **Solution** : The solution was to convert pandas `Timestamp` objects using `pandas.date.date()` function to convert them to `datetime` objects - then the dates could be compared in the View. 
    ```python
        time_diff = pd.date_range(start=start_date, end=end_date)
        return [date.date() for date in time_diff]
    ```
